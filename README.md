# Introduction:
This package is buil on top of jax numerical package
as a way to simulate optical propagation through theoris of 
fourier optics. A the first pass we use the fresnel propagation
kernel as the better approach. In the future it can be extended 
to include angular spectrum approach for an exact approach.

The reason for using jax is to keep support for autograd.
